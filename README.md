First repository

Hi there. 

I'm Azima and I'm kind of new to coding. Right now I'm still completing an "HTML CSS" course, so I'm still kind of a noob :P. My goal is to become a successful Software Developer. Anyways, i hope to advance with all of your help here and that i can reach my goal. Thanks for taking the time to read.
